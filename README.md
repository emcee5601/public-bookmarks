These are things I often share with others. Here for convenience.

This is probably better done as a wiki, but that's a project for future me.


# Air filtration
- [Filter recommendation tool](https://cleanairstars.com/filters/) by [Clean Air Stars](https://cleanairstars.com/)
  - [raw data for USA](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17j6FZwvqHRFkGoH5996u5JdR7tk4_7fNuTxAK7kc4Fk/edit?gid=1662890714)  (The spreadsheet has a tab per country)
- [AirFanta products](https://www.amazon.com/s?me=A1ZR1THYZD46CX) on Amazon (various filters)
  - [Adam Wong](https://x.com/Engineer_Wong) is the creator
  - I like the [AirFanta 3Pro](https://www.amazon.com/AirFanta-based-Rosenthal-Purifier-3813ft2/dp/B0CJTYWQBT/) air purifier. It can be disassembled and packed in a carry-on or tote bag. Has high CADR, adjustable fan speed (which means noise is adjustable), and is reasonably affordable ($150-160 for the device, $60 for filter replacements at the time of this writing)

# Face masks / Respirators
## Where to buy masks
### ZIMI masks
These are my current favorite masks. No nose wire to adjust. Comfortable for long wear. Passes fit test for me.
  - Zimi has their own website now: https://zimiair.com/
  - [ZIMI mask links](https://t.co/cHjlzsjPIg) for [Superbuy](https://www.superbuy.com/order) (cheaper, but [PITA](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pain_in_the_ass) buying experience)
  - [ZIMI masks on Superbuy](https://www.superbuy.com/en/page/subject/?id=22259) - looks like this is all Zimi products
  - [ZIMI masks](https://ppeo.com/brand/zimi-air/) on PPEO (pricier, but probably better buying experience)
  - [Zhou Liang's mask](https://x.com/zhouliang_mask) is the creator

### [ElastoMaskPro](https://reusable-respirators.com/product/elastomaskpro-respirator/) (1 piece elastomeric)

# Recommendations for myself
Mostly notes to myself in case I have to re-acquire items on here for some reason. Some notes for observers.  Prices might be out of date.

| Budget | Item | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
|$150 | AirFanta 3Pro | Versatile. Good enough in many situations: Can be quiet, can be packed and transported, can filter a large space. Affordable. Purchased 2: kept 1, gifted 1.|
